# Koc University Deep Learning (COMP 541) by Prof. Deniz yuret. 

## in this repository you will find my implementation of the course class samples, assignments, and labs by Julia. 


### Class Samples:
- **Mnsit One layer:** a comparision of basic models (One layer perceptron, Adaline, Softmax) in solving Mnsit hand-written digit recognition. Each model was tested using its optimization function and by deriving its optimizing function from its loss function

### Assignments:
-  **IMDB sentiment analysis:** a review sentiments classification using Naive Bayes model with N-gram extension -- maximum accuracy achieved :  0.84588

### Labs:
-  **Linear regression:** train a linear regression model based on Boston Housing Data
-  **Mnsit Softmax:** train a softmax classifier model for Mnsit hand-written digit recognition -- numeric gradient and data minibatching were implemented
-  **Mnsit CNN analysis:** train and compare different CNN and MLP models for Mnsit in order to optamize the number of parameters such that we achieve 100% accuracy on the training data set.
-  **T-maze:** train and compare LSTM based model with different hidden layer sizes as well as visualizing the weight matrices.
